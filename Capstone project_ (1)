It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge these challenges and ask for help. I want to be very clear from the start:\n","\n","**IMPORTANT: I am an AI assistant and not a medical professional. Constant heart pain is a very serious symptom that requires immediate medical attention.**\n","\n","Please read this first section very carefully.\n","\n","### Step 1: The Absolute First Priority – See a Doctor Immediately\n","\n","**Constant heart pain is not normal and could be a sign of a serious condition.** Please do not wait.\n","\n","*   **Call your doctor right away** and tell them you are 73 and have constant heart pain.\n","*   **If the pain is new, severe, or comes with other symptoms like shortness of breath, pain in your arm or jaw, dizziness, or sweating, please call for emergency medical services (like 911 in the US) immediately.**\n","\n","A doctor needs to diagnose the cause of your pain. They can perform tests like an EKG, blood tests, or others to see what is happening with your heart. This is the most important step you can take for your health right now.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 2: Be Honest with Your Doctor About Your Drinking\n","\n","When you see the doctor, you must be completely honest about your drinking habit. Your doctor is there to help you, not to judge you.\n","\n","Heavy and long-term alcohol use can severely damage the heart. It can lead to:\n","*   **Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy:** The heart muscle becomes weak, enlarged, and cannot pump blood effectively. This can cause the pain you are feeling.\n","*   **High Blood Pressure:** Alcohol raises blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke.\n","*   **Arrhythmias (Irregular Heartbeat):** Alcohol can disrupt the heart's electrical signals, causing it to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly.\n","*   **Increased risk of heart attack and stroke.**\n","\n","Your doctor can create a safe plan for you to reduce or stop drinking. **Quitting alcohol suddenly can be dangerous and even life-threatening (delirium tremens).** You may need medical supervision to do it safely.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 3: A General Plan for Heart Health (To Discuss With Your Doctor)\n","\n","Once you have received a medical evaluation for your heart pain and are working with your doctor on the drinking habit, here are the key areas you can focus on to take care of your heart. **Do not start any of these without your doctor's approval.**\n","\n","#### 1. Manage Your Alcohol Intake (Under Medical Guidance)\n","This is your most critical lifestyle change. Your doctor can connect you with resources like:\n","*   **Support Groups:** Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has helped millions of people. There are meetings specifically for older adults.\n","*   **Counseling or Therapy:** A therapist can help you understand the reasons for your drinking and develop new coping mechanisms.\n","*   **Medication:** There are medications that can help reduce cravings and support recovery.\n","\n","#### 2. Adopt a Heart-Healthy Diet\n","Small changes can make a big difference.\n","*   **Reduce Salt (Sodium):** Too much salt raises blood pressure. Avoid processed foods, canned soups, and fast food. Don't add extra salt to your meals.\n","*   **Eat More Fruits and Vegetables:** They are full of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are good for your heart.\n","*   **Choose Whole Grains:** Switch from white bread and pasta to whole-wheat bread, brown rice, and oatmeal.\n","*   **Eat Lean Protein:** Choose fish (especially salmon and tuna), chicken without the skin, beans, and lentils.\n","*   **Limit Unhealthy Fats:** Cut back on fried foods, fatty meats, and commercially baked goods.\n","\n","#### 3. Gentle, Doctor-Approved Physical Activity\n","**Do not start any exercise program until your doctor has checked your heart and says it is safe.**\n","*   If your doctor gives you the okay, start slowly.\n","*   **Walking** is one of the best exercises for heart health. Start with just 5-10 minutes a day and gradually increase the time as you feel stronger.\n","*   Other gentle activities could include swimming or stationary cycling.\n","*   The goal is to get your body moving, but **safely**.\n","\n","#### 4. Manage Stress\n","Stress can be very hard on the heart.\n","*   **Connect with others:** Spend time with family, friends, or join a social group. Feeling connected is important.\n","*   **Find a relaxing hobby:** Listening to music, reading, gardening, or gentle stretching can help calm your mind.\n","*   **Practice deep breathing:** Simply sitting quietly and taking slow, deep breaths for a few minutes can lower your heart rate and blood pressure.\n","\n","#### 5. Take All Medications as Prescribed\n","Your doctor will likely prescribe medications for your heart, blood pressure, or cholesterol. It is crucial to take them exactly as instructed.\n","\n","### Your Action Plan, Starting Today:\n","\n","1.  **IMMEDIATELY:** Contact a doctor or emergency services about your constant heart pain. This is a medical emergency.\n","2.  **BE HONEST:** Tell the doctor everything about your pain and your drinking habit.\n","3.  **MAKE A PLAN TOGETHER:** Work with your doctor to create a safe plan to address your drinking and improve your heart health.\n","\n","You have already taken the first brave step by asking for help. Now, please take the next, most important step and get professional medical care. Your life is precious, and it is absolutely possible to make positive changes for your health, even at 73.\n"]}]}},"2057cf7729354c69a5b7e39a67ca2b4f":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","model_name":"LayoutModel","model_module_version":"1.2.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_model_module_version":"1.2.0","_model_name":"LayoutModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"LayoutView","align_content":null,"align_items":null,"align_self":null,"border":null,"bottom":null,"display":null,"flex":null,"flex_flow":null,"grid_area":null,"grid_auto_columns":null,"grid_auto_flow":null,"grid_auto_rows":null,"grid_column":null,"grid_gap":null,"grid_row":null,"grid_template_areas":null,"grid_template_columns":null,"grid_template_rows":null,"height":null,"justify_content":null,"justify_items":null,"left":null,"margin":null,"max_height":null,"max_width":null,"min_height":null,"min_width":null,"object_fit":null,"object_position":null,"order":null,"overflow":null,"overflow_x":null,"overflow_y":null,"padding":null,"right":null,"top":null,"visibility":null,"width":null}},"61bdecaddbf04172b812f2c6a3d0d407":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","model_name":"LayoutModel","model_module_version":"1.2.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_model_module_version":"1.2.0","_model_name":"LayoutModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"LayoutView","align_content":null,"align_items":null,"align_self":null,"border":null,"bottom":null,"display":null,"flex":null,"flex_flow":null,"grid_area":null,"grid_auto_columns":null,"grid_auto_flow":null,"grid_auto_rows":null,"grid_column":null,"grid_gap":null,"grid_row":null,"grid_template_areas":null,"grid_template_columns":null,"grid_template_rows":null,"height":null,"justify_content":null,"justify_items":null,"left":null,"margin":null,"max_height":null,"max_width":null,"min_height":null,"min_width":null,"object_fit":null,"object_position":null,"order":null,"overflow":null,"overflow_x":null,"overflow_y":null,"padding":null,"right":null,"top":null,"visibility":null,"width":"auto"}},"95f50c26026542539f7a27203da7ec0f":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"DescriptionStyleModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"DescriptionStyleModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"StyleView","description_width":""}},"a7e1dec66a294eedb6b72daac7534ff1":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","model_name":"LayoutModel","model_module_version":"1.2.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_model_module_version":"1.2.0","_model_name":"LayoutModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"LayoutView","align_content":null,"align_items":null,"align_self":null,"border":null,"bottom":null,"display":null,"flex":null,"flex_flow":null,"grid_area":null,"grid_auto_columns":null,"grid_auto_flow":null,"grid_auto_rows":null,"grid_column":null,"grid_gap":null,"grid_row":null,"grid_template_areas":null,"grid_template_columns":null,"grid_template_rows":null,"height":null,"justify_content":null,"justify_items":null,"left":null,"margin":null,"max_height":null,"max_width":null,"min_height":null,"min_width":null,"object_fit":null,"object_position":null,"order":null,"overflow":null,"overflow_x":null,"overflow_y":null,"padding":null,"right":null,"top":null,"visibility":null,"width":null}},"6d8c0e6b4b4b4e8fadb0b9f524600c87":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"ButtonStyleModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"ButtonStyleModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"StyleView","button_color":null,"font_weight":""}},"f9770adc01d44b6c938a5ea16d11a55d":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","model_name":"LayoutModel","model_module_version":"1.2.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_model_module_version":"1.2.0","_model_name":"LayoutModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"LayoutView","align_content":null,"align_items":null,"align_self":null,"border":"1px

It often occurs during physical activity or stress when the heart needs more oxygen-rich blood than the narrowed arteries can supply.\n","*   **Shortness of Breath:** Your heart may not be able to pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, causing you to feel winded, especially with exertion.\n","*   **Fatigue:** Extreme tiredness from simple activities.\n","*   **Heart Attack:** If a plaque ruptures and a blood clot forms, it can completely block an artery. **Symptoms of a heart attack require immediate emergency medical attention (call 911 or your local emergency number)** and include:\n","    *   Crushing chest pain or pressure that may spread to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, or teeth.\n","    *   Cold sweats.\n","    *   Dizziness or lightheadedness.\n","    *   Nausea or indigestion.\n","\n","### 2. Symptoms Related to Brain Problems (Stroke)\n","When plaque narrows or blocks the arteries leading to your brain, it can cause a stroke. **A stroke is a medical emergency.** Use the **F.A.S.T.** acronym to spot the signs:\n","\n","*   **F - Face Drooping:** One side of the face droops or is numb.\n","*   **A - Arm Weakness:** One arm is weak or numb. When asked to raise both arms, one arm drifts downward.\n","*   **S - Speech Difficulty:** Speech is slurred, or the person is unable to speak or is hard to understand.\n","*   **T - Time to call for help:** If you see any of these signs, call for emergency help immediately.\n","\n","Other stroke symptoms can include sudden confusion, trouble seeing, a severe headache, or loss of balance.\n","\n","### 3. Symptoms Related to Limb Problems (Peripheral Artery Disease - PAD)\n","When plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to your legs and feet, it can cause:\n","\n","*   **Intermittent Claudication:** This is the most common symptom. It's cramping pain or fatigue in your leg or hip muscles (calves, thighs, or buttocks) during activity, like walking or climbing stairs. The pain usually disappears after a few minutes of rest.\n","*   **Numbness or Weakness:** In the legs.\n","*   **Coldness:** In one lower leg or foot compared to the other side.\n","*   **Sores That Won't Heal:** On your toes, feet, or legs.\n","*   **A Change in the Color of Your Legs.**\n","*   **Poor Nail Growth or Hair Loss** on the legs.\n","\n","### Rare Physical Signs of Extremely High Cholesterol\n","In some rare cases, particularly with genetic conditions like *familial hypercholesterolemia*, people can have visible signs of very high cholesterol deposits. These are not common:\n","\n","*   **Xanthomas:** Fatty, yellowish bumps or patches on the skin, often found on the elbows, knees, knuckles, or tendons (like the Achilles tendon).\n","*   **Xanthelasma:** Yellowish cholesterol deposits on or around the eyelids.\n","*   **Arcus Senilis:** A whitish-gray ring around the outside of the cornea (the colored part of the eye). While common in older adults, its appearance in people under 45 can be a sign of very high cholesterol.\n","\n","### The Key Takeaway\n","\n","Because high cholesterol is symptomless, you cannot wait to \"feel sick\" before taking action. The only way to know if you have high cholesterol is through a simple blood test called a **lipid panel** or **lipid profile**.\n","\n","This is why regular check-ups with your doctor are so important. Early detection and management (through lifestyle changes and/or medication) can prevent the serious, life-threatening complications listed above.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ebb7a022"},"source":["### Action Required: Set Your Google Gemini API Key\n","\n","To proceed, you **must** replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` in the previous code cell (`bcee50c5`) with your actual Google Gemini API key.\n","\n","**How to get your API Key:**\n","1.
